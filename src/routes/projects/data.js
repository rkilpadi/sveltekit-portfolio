        summary: "This post dives deep into backpropagation calculus, the math that makes training neural networks possible. With NumPy as my only dependency, I was able to classify handwritten digits from 0-9 with 97% accuracy in under 100 lines of Python."

        date: "April 2025",
        summary: "Tarka, meaning \"logic\" in Sanskrit, is the name I gave to my toy Lisp-like language that can mathematically verify itself. To do this, I modified a compiler that I had already built to include a verification condition generator. While it isn't technically isn't extensive enough to be a full-fledged Lisp dialect, Tarka is Turing complete and can prove partial correctness of its programs."
