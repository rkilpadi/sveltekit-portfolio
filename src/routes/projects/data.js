        title: 'The Math Behind Building a Neural Network From Scratch',
        date: 'June 2025',
        summary: 'When I was first learning about machine learning, I remember being told not to worry about the math behind the models I built. Now that I have a deeper background in math, I decided to take a look into the mathematical foundations of neural networks and try to build my own using only numpy. This post will be math-heavy, but if you have an understanding of linear algebra and multivariable calculus, you\'ll understand why the logic behind neural networks essentially boils down to a minimization problem.'
