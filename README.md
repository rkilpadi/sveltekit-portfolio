# Ryan Kilpadi

Welcome to my personal website, built with SvelteKit, Vite, and Vercel.  
The background is an interactive [Perlin noise field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) simulation created using p5.js.
It inspired [Flowplane](https://flowplane.vercel.app/), an interactive web app I made that plots 2D dynamical systems.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rkilpadi/sveltekit-portfolio.git
cd sveltekit-portfolio
npm install
```

Start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Create a production build:
